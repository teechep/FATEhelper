  "Punchline": "Makes FATEs suck slightly less, guaranteed! Disclaimer: atma drop rates will continue to suck.",
  "Description": "Automatic level sync and re-enabling tank stance when targeting a FATE enemy or object, and automatically target Forlorns.
Can also display a list of all FATEs in the current area with: time remaining, percent completed, and bonus marker. Clicking on the FATE name will flag it, and automatically teleport you to the closest aetheryte (if it's faster than flying there).
NOTE: this plugin does not track specific FATEs. You can add the Sonar plugin to track those.",
